# Blackjack

A very simple Blackjack game made in HTML and JavaScript. 

## Game rules

The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards. The cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 11 points.
